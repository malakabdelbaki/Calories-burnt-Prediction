Notebook on kaggle can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/malakabdelbaki/calories-burnt-prediction)
## Data Collection

Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fmendes/fmendesdat263xdemos)

## Data Preprocessing

- No null values or outliers
- Do encoding on categorical features
    - Gender

### Data Analysis

- Distribution plots to explore continuous values:
    - Age
    - Height
- Count plots to explore discrete values
    - Gender
- construct heat map to understand correlation between features

### Splitting features and Target

- Split the dataset to 2 arrays
    - `X` : features
    - `Y` : target
    

### Split data into training data and testing data

- `X_train, Y_train` : 80% of data to train model
- `X_test, Y_test` : 20% of data to test accuracy

### Train the model

- Train XGBoost Regressor model on `X_train, Y_train`

### Model Evaluation

- Use the model to predict the cost for `X_test,` and using Mean absolute error value compare the `Y_test` with the predictions generated by the model
- Mean absolute error =  1.48
